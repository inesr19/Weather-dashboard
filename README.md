## Weather Dashboard

### Description

The purpose of this webpage is to give the user current weather data and the five day forecast. The weather APIs came from openweathermap.org  where three AJAX calls were used to assemble the appropriate data. When the user types in a city name in the provided search bar, they are given the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index. The uv index is highlighted in green when it is low, yellow when it is moderate, and red when it is high. In the five day forecast, the upcoming date is displayed along with the day temperature and humidity percentage.
